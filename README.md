# Data Science Portfolio

The following is a repository for some of the data science projects I've worked on either for class projects in my master's program or as self-taught projects to improve my skils. All of the projects completed in Python are stored here as IPython Notebooks and those in R are raw code (although these may be published on RPubs in the near future). 

I've also built a portfolio site using the [minimalmistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme and hosted it on Github Pages. You can access the full portfolio site here: [Portfolio Site](https://sstringer00100.github.io/portfolio/)
